<br /><span class="small">(<i>Icterus audubonii</i>.)</span></h2>
<p>The name oriole is from the French
word oriol, which is a corruption of the
Latin word aureolus, meaning golden.
The name was originally applied to a
vire, but is now used in a much wider
sense and includes a number of birds.</p>
<p>The true orioles are birds of the Old
World and are closely related to the
thrushes. It is said that no fewer than
twenty species from Asia and Africa have
been described.</p>
<p>The orioles of America belong to a very
different group of birds and are related to
our blackbirds, the bobolink and the
meadowlark. All these birds belong to
the family Icteridae, the representatives
of which are confined to the New World.</p>
<p>The genus of orioles (Icterus) contains
about forty species, chiefly natives of
Central and South America. The plumage
of nearly all the species is more or
less colored with shades of yellow, orange
and black.</p>
<p>Audubon&rsquo;s Oriole, the male of which
we illustrate, has a very limited range,
including the &ldquo;valley of the Lower Rio
Grande in Texas and southward in Mexico
to Oaxaca.&rdquo; It is more common in
central and eastern Mexico than in any
other part of its range. In the summer,
it only frequents the denser forests of its
Texas home, but during the winter
months it will approach the inhabited regions.</p>
<p>The Mexicans capture these Orioles
and offer them for sale. In captivity,
however, they seem to lose their vivacity
and will not sing. &ldquo;When free their usual
song is a prolonged and repeated
whistle of extraordinary mellowness and
sweetness, each note varying in pitch
from the preceding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that this beautiful bird is frequently
called upon to become the foster
parents of the offspring of some of those
birds that have neither the inclination to
build their own nests or to raise their
own families. The ingenious nests of the
orioles seem to be especially attractive to
these tramp birds which possess parasitic
tastes.</p>
<p>The red-eyed cowbird (Callothrus robustus),
of the Southern United States
and Central America, seems to be the pest
that infests the homes of Audubon&rsquo;s
Oriole. It has been stated that the majority
of the sets of eggs collected from
the nests of this Oriole contain one or
more of the cowbird&rsquo;s eggs. It is also
probable that many of the Oriole&rsquo;s eggs
are destroyed by the cowbirds as well as
by other agencies, and thus, though the
raising of two broods the same season is
frequently attempted, the species is far
from abundant.</p>
<p>Regarding the nesting habits of the
Audubon&rsquo;s Oriole, Captain Charles Bendire
says, &ldquo;The nest of this Oriole is usually
placed in mesquite trees, in thickets
and open woods, from six to fourteen
feet from the ground. It is a semipensile
structure, woven of fine, wire-like grass
used while still green and resembles those
of the hooded and orchard orioles, which
are much better known. The nest is firmly
attached, both on the top and sides, to
small branches and growing twigs and,
for the size of the bird, it appears rather
small. One now before me measures three
inches in depth inside by about the same
in inner diameter. The rim of the nest is
somewhat contracted to prevent the eggs
from being thrown out during high
winds. The inner lining consists of somewhat
finer grass tops, which still retain
considerable strength and are even now,
when perfectly dry, difficult to break.
Only a single nest of those found was
placed in a bunch of Spanish moss and
this was suspended within reach of the
ground; the others were attached to small
twigs.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>The number of eggs vary from two to
five and &ldquo;sets of one or two eggs of this
Oriole, with two or three cowbird&rsquo;s eggs,
seem to be most frequently found, some
of the first named eggs being thrown out
to make room.&rdquo; The eggs are ovate in
form and the general color varies from
white with a bluish cast to white with a
grayish cast and in some instances a purple
shade predominates. The markings
vary greatly both in color and form. They
may be either thread-like, in streaks or in
blotches. In color they may be various
shades of either brown, purple or lavender.</p>
<p>The food of Audubon&rsquo;s Oriole consists
of insects and, to some extent, of berries
and other fruits. Mr. Chark, who studied
the habits of this species in Texas, says
that he observed it frequently feeding on
the fruit of the hackberry. He also states
that these birds were usually in pairs and
exhibited a retiring disposition, preferring
the thick foliage of the margins of
streams rather than that of more open
and exposed places.</p>

<h2 id="c5">FROM AN ORNITHOLOGIST&rsquo;S YEAR BOOK.
<br /><span class="small">THE HEART OF A DRYAD.</span>
<br />I.</h2>
<p>It was an oak wood. A few hickories
and chestnuts grew there, but the oaks
ruled; great of girth, brawny of limb,
with knotted muscles like the figures of
Michael Angelo or Tintoretto&rsquo;s workmen
in his painting of the Forge of Vulcan. As
to coloring, the oaks were of the Venetian
painter&rsquo;s following, every oak of them!
In summer they were &ldquo;men in green,&rdquo;
rich, vigorous green, with blue shadows
between the rustling boughs; in early autumn,
though russet in the shadow, the
sunshine showed them a deep and splendid
crimson, pouring through them like a
libation to the gods of the lower earth,
and to the noble dead, for the Dryad had
a heart for heroes and all oak-like men.</p>
<p>Immediately before the great winds
came, stripping them bare, and dashing
silver cymbals to wild airs of triumph,
they wore a sober brown, but it put on a
glow, as of bronze or heated metal after
a rain, when the sun&rsquo;s rays smote them
with shining spears smiting aslant with
unwonted glittering. Under the moon
or after a freeze they were all clad in steel,
armor of proof, and mighty was the tumult,
as of meeting swords, when the
great boughs swung, and the long icicles
fell upon ice below.</p>
<p>But these days were far off. It was
summer, and a crystal brook slipped from
level to level, singing its sweet water-song,
and bringing cool water to bathe
the feet of the oak which the Dryad loved
and decked with green garlands. The
orioles loved it, flashing here and there
with rich red gold or flame-like orange
on breast and wings and soft, velvety
black on head and shoulders, splendidly
beautiful as some tropic flower, they
chose the end of an oak bough to hang
their pensile nest. The male oriole
shone in the sun, but his mate glowed
with a duller hue, an orange veiled with
gray, and mottled and spotted or splashed
with white and fuscous and black, as a
brooding creature should be that sits all
day long amid the play of fleeting light
and shade upon constant color. But both
were beautiful in their strong and darting
flight, and their labors of love.</p>
<p>The mother alone fashioned the nest,
weaving it strongly of grasses and bark,
of fibre, hair and string, and lashing it
firmly near the end, a hanging cradle for
the wind to rock at will and safely, and
beautifully adorned with a fantastic pattern
of green oak leaves, woven across,
and aiding to conceal the nest itself. The
eggs, four to six, were white, but marked
with strange characters, sometimes distinct,
sometimes obscure, a hieroglyphic
of black or fuscous lines, over which the
mother brooded patiently for many days.
But the male oriole was not indifferent,
even while the young were in the egg.
He did not fear to expose himself upon an
upper branch, where he could watch untiringly
over the safety of the beloved
nest and all day long, in bright or cloudy
weather, floated down to his silent mate
a song of courage and tenderness.</p>
<p>Ah, no shepherds in far-off Arcady
ever piped more sweetly to their beloved
than this winged lover! His note is wild
and free, a touch of anxious pleading perhaps
in the brooding song that one does
not catch in the first triumphant cry of
joy with which he flashes upon our sight
in April, but inexpressibly sweet and
liquid. It is essentially music of the pipes,
like the soft airs blown by lips of happy
children upon reeds cut from the brook-side
in the first joyous days of spring, but
it is different in its airy quality, as if a
melody, unfinished, were floating far
above our heads! They are loving house-holders,
and, if undisturbed, will return,
year after year, to the same nest.</p>
<p>Happy is the Dryad that dwells in an
oak where the orioles build and sing!</p>

<p class="lr">&mdash;Jean Ingelow, &ldquo;The Four Bridges.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The Godwits form an interesting group
of the shore birds (Limicolae) and belong
in the same family as the snipes and sandpipers.
They command attention not
alone because of their habits, but also
because they have for centuries been
considered a delicate food for man, and
much has been written in praise of their
flesh.</p>
<p>Early in the sixteenth century one of
the European species was rated as &ldquo;worth
three times as much as the snipe,&rdquo; and
was considered a delicacy of the French
epicure. We are told that the black-tailed
Godwit in the year 1766 was sold
in England for half-a-crown. Ben Jonson
speaks enthusiastically of this bird as
a delicate morsel for the appetite.</p>
<p>The origin of the name Godwit is
veiled in obscurity. It has been suggested
that it may be a corruption of the
two words good and the antiquated word
wight, the latter meaning swift, though
the Godwits are not birds of very rapid
flight.</p>
<p>The Marbled Godwit belongs to a
genus (Limosa) which, though not rich
in the number of species, has representatives
throughout the Northern Hemisphere.
This bird frequents muddy pools
and marshes and wet, sandy shores. It
is this habit that suggested to the naturalist
the generic name, which is derived
from the Latin word limosus, meaning
muddy.</p>
<p>As is the case with many of our game
birds, this species bears a number of common
names, such as the Straight-Billed
Curlew, the Marbled or Brown Marlin,
the Red Curlew and, among sportsmen,
the Dough and the Doe Bird.</p>
<p>With the exception of the long-billed
curlew the Marbled Godwit is the largest
of the &ldquo;Bay Birds.&rdquo; These two birds
closely resemble each other in coloration,
but may be easily distinguished by the
characteristics of the bills, which are very
long. The terminal half of the bill of
the curlew is curved downward, while
that of the Godwit is either straight or
slightly curved upward.</p>
<p>The geographical distribution of the
Marbled Godwit includes the whole of
North America, though it is infrequent
on the Atlantic coast. Its nesting range
is chiefly limited to the interior from
Iowa and Nebraska northward to the
Saskatchewan. In winter it migrates
to Central America, Cuba and the northern
part of South America.</p>
<p>In company with the long-billed curlew
and some species of sandpipers it
builds its nest on the grassy banks of
rivers and ponds, usually in some natural
depression. Occasionally, however,
the nests are found on moist prairies some
distance from a stream. In these grass-lined
nests are laid the three or four
bright olivaceous, drab or creamy buff
eggs that are variously spotted or
blotched with varying shades of brown.
They are domestic and seemingly devoted
to their fellows. When one of their
number is wounded and unable to fly
they will frequently remain in the vicinity,
flying around the spot where lies their
wounded comrade.</p>
<p>Dr. Coues tells us that &ldquo;on intrusion
near the nest the birds mount in the
air with loud, piercing cries, hovering
slowly around with labored flight, in evident
distress and approaching sometimes
within a few feet of the observer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its food consists of the smaller
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
crustaceans, worms, snails, insects and
their larvae. These are captured from
the surface of the water, on the shore or
are probed for, with the long, sensitive
bills, in the soft soil of the banks or under
shallow water. When feeding it
moves in an easy and graceful manner.
Its grace and dignity well merit the saying
that &ldquo;it is one of the most beautiful
of the birds sought by the sportsman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neltje Blanchan has very aptly described
the habits of this bird. She says:
&ldquo;It is not the intention of the Godwit to
give anyone a near view of either plumage
or bill. The most stealthy intruder
on its domains&mdash;salt or fresh water
shores, marshes or prairie lands&mdash;startles
it to wing; its loud, whistled notes sound
the alarm to other marlins hidden among
the tall sedges, and the entire flock flies
off at an easy, steady pace, not rapid, yet
not to be overtaken afoot. A beautiful
posture, common to the plovers, curlews,
terns and some other birds, is struck
just as they alight. Raising the tips of
the wings till they meet high above the
back, the marlins suggest the favorite
attitude of angels shown by the early
Italian painters.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c7">A BIRD-JOKE AT LEAFY LAWN.</h2>
<p>In early spring Robin Redbreast returned
to Leafy Lawn and selected a new
site for his nest in the same apple tree his
father and grandfather had occupied during
preceding summers. No other birds
had yet arrived and Robin jumped about
on the sprouting lawn master of all he
surveyed.</p>
<p>He soon discovered to his sorrow that
those selfish, quarrelsome sparrows who
tormented the birds last summer and
drove away the wrens, had gone no farther
during the winter than to the eaves
of a near barn, and were already back to
their nest in the tall poplar, scolding and
threatening as disagreeably as ever. But
Robin noticed that the limb which held
their nest so high was dead and he hoped
a strong wind would dash limb, nest and
ugly sparrows all to the ground.</p>
<p>Robin looked very handsome in his
crimson vest, hopping over the grass in a
scalloped path, with his modest little mate
following in a similar path beside him.
Suddenly they stopped and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely that is Mr. Woodpecker
pounding on the tin roof-drain,&rdquo; said
Robin; and Mrs. Robin looked about
curiously and spied Mrs. Woodpecker on
a near tree listening to her husband&rsquo;s
wonderful drumming. Mrs. Woodpecker
was thinking what a fine nest such a
strong husband could cut out and what
quantities of corn and nuts he could hammer
into the bark of the trees for an extra
food supply. In a very short time the
woodpeckers selected the balm-of-Gilead
tree by the gate for their home and the
work began of cutting and tossing the
tiny shavings and so making a hole large
enough to accommodate Mrs. Woodpecker
while she sat over the ivory eggs
waiting the day of their hatching.</p>
<p>Mr. Woodpecker was recognized as
king of Leafy Lawn, perhaps because of
his lordly manner and fine clothes. He
always wore a jet black coat and white
satin vest, and what was queer on a king,
a large scarlet bonnet.</p>
<p>A few days after the arrival of the
Woodpeckers, Robin saw Mr. Blue Jay
making a circuitous route to the tall pine
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
and he knew the Jays had located there.
Though Mr. Blue Jay was always cautious,
trying to deceive every one concerning
the whereabouts of his home, he
himself knew every other nest in the yard.</p>
<p>So persistent was he in patrolling
Leafy Lawn, jumping from tree to tree
and from branch to branch, reporting his
presence, and in case of danger threatening,
squawking so loudly and repeatedly,
that it was agreed, as he already had
a blue uniform, that he should be the policeman
for this precinct.</p>
<p>There came a day early in the season
when Mr. Woodpecker, Robin Redbreast
and Mr. Blue Jay all assembled
within speaking distance on the lower
branches of a silver maple tree and excitedly
discussed the arrival of a number of
birds which they had heard early that
morning but had been unable to find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; said Robin, &ldquo;awakened me
from the twig near her nest, where I usually
sleep and keep guard, and she said
that one of our kin had arrived for she
had heard a voice exactly like mine from
the plum tree. Hoping it was one of my
brothers I searched eagerly until sunrise,
and though I heard him twice I could not
find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blue Jay was more excited than
before and turned about, twitched his tail
violently, scolded and sputtered that he
had had just such an experience and he
believed the sparrows had added witchcraft
to their other sins and were trying
to hoodoo the birds of Leafy Lawn.</p>
<p>A frightened sparrow overheard this
accusation and came near enough to protest
that they were not guilty and had
been themselves trying in vain to find
their newly-arrived English relatives,
whom they had believed they heard that
morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Woodpecker said it might be no
personal affair of his as he had heard no
drumming nor mocking of his song, but
if Leafy Lawn were to be occupied by
kildares, bobolinks, meadow larks and
blackbirds he thought there would be
scarce picking of worms, bugs or seeds
for the old settlers who were the rightful
possessors of these premises and it was a
serious condition of things. In closing
his pompous speech he shook his scarlet
bonnet furiously, smoothed his waistcoat
and jumped upon a higher limp and called
off his &ldquo;chit-it-it-it-it-it&rdquo; so shrill and high
that his companions were for the moment
alarmed lest he should split his throat.
But he stopped as suddenly as he had begun,
and upon the silence that followed
the birds heard, as surely as they saw the
blossoms on the apple trees, the song of
the thrush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is undoubtedly a hobgoblin,&rdquo;
hoarsely whispered Mr. Woodpecker,
&ldquo;for Mr. Blue Jay swore to me this morning
that during the seasons he and his ancestors
have patrolled this lawn never
have they seen a thrush even alight here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was decided that the three birds
make one more immediate and thorough
search for the monster hobgoblin which
infested the Lawn.</p>
<p>Imagine their chagrin when they saw
tilting upon the unleaved twig of a late
catalpa tree a modest little gray bird with
keen, bright eyes, who commenced a garble
of all their songs called off in such
merriment that the birds could not but
appreciate the sport. Then the stranger,
who was no other than Mr. Cat-bird, a
cousin to the brown mocking-bird of the
south, gave a weird cry exactly like a cat&rsquo;s
meow which so frightened the birds they
flew hastily away to their several homes.</p>
<p>Mr. Cat-bird was welcomed to Leafy
Lawn, for his beautiful voice was an esteemed
acquisition to the morning
chorus, but he could not deceive the
birds again with his imitative songs.</p>
<p>Many a time, however, he would sit
upon the corner of the house roof and
perpetrate his joke on the boy in the
hammock below, who thought he knew
much about birds, but who could not understand
why, when he heard so many
different voices, there was only a little
gray cat-bird within sight.</p>

<h2 id="c8">THE RUSTY BLACKBIRD OR GRACKLE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Scolecophagus carolinus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Unlike the other blackbirds and our
common orioles the Rusty Blackbird
must not be sought in the orchards and
fields of our farms and waysides, but in
our forests and the heavily wooded banks
of mountain streams and lakes. In
such places this retiring bird passes the
breeding season and raises its family in
quiet solitude. It even seems to shun
the company of its own kind and, unlike
the red-winged blackbird, is seldom seen
in large flocks. It is only in the spring
that we may observe even small flocks
from &ldquo;whence issues a confused medley
of whistles, sweeter and higher-pitched
than the best efforts of the redwings.&rdquo;
Captain Charles Bendire says: &ldquo;The ordinary
call note sounds like &lsquo;tehack, tehack,&rsquo;
several times repeated; another
like &lsquo;turnlee, turnlee, turnlee,&rsquo; uttered in
a clear tone and varied occasionally to
&lsquo;trallahee, trallahee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few birds exhibit a more happy disposition.
They seem always to be perfectly
satisfied with their surroundings.
One writer, quietly watching them, gathered
in the trees about him, says that
&ldquo;The wind whistled loudly through the
branches above, but these lively fellows
began a serenade so joyous and full of
gleeful abandon that I lingered long to
hear them. In singing they opened the
bill widely and the throat swelled with
melody. Their notes are rich, varied
and energetic. They are almost constantly
in motion, chasing each other or
flying from perch to perch, singing merrily
most of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rusty Blackbird has a wide
range. It is more common in the eastern
portion of North America from
Florida and the Gulf of Mexico northward
to the northern limit of the forests.
Westward, though constantly decreasing
in numbers as the distance increases
from the Atlantic coast, it is found as far
as the great plains and very rarely on the
eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.
It frequents practically the whole forest
area of British America from the Atlantic
to the Pacific ocean. Mr. E. W. Nelson
says: &ldquo;I found it abundant at the Yukon
mouth, where the widely extended
areas of bush grown country offered suitable
shelter and where it consequently
nested in considerable numbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their nesting range covers the whole
of British America, but in the United
States it is restricted to a comparatively
small area. Its nests have only been reported
as occurring in portions of New
England and in the wild Adirondack forests.
In winter it makes its home in the
Middle and Southern States. At this
time, from necessity, it is often seen
around barn and stock yards, feeding on
the grain that has been dropped by the
cattle.</p>
<p>During the summer season the Rusty
Blackbird depends almost entirely on
animal life for its food, eating caterpillars,
moths and other insects, worms,
snails and spiders, also eating, to a limited
extent, wild berries.</p>
<p>The nest of the Rusty Blackbird is
large and substantially constructed. It
is generally placed in cone-bearing trees
and is seldom more than ten feet from
the ground. As a rule, trees growing in
swampy and rather inaccessible places
are selected. The base of the nest &ldquo;is
principally composed of sphagnum moss
and earth, forming a firm, hard platform
on which the nest proper is built. This
is thickly covered on the outside with
small tamarack and spruce twigs, mixed
with a few blades of grass, pieces of fern
and long green moss, especially at the
base. The inner cup is thickly and neatly
lined with fine bright green grass.&rdquo;
These blackbirds are not quarrelsome and
are devoted parents, both sexes assisting
in the care of the young, which are able
to leave the nest in about fifteen or sixteen
days. Our illustration shows the
fall and winter plumage of the male.
During the breeding season the plumage
is a glossy bluish black.</p>

<h2 id="c9">WHAT EVOLUTION MEANS.</h2>
<p>If any person devoted his time to the
correction of popular errors, there is no
probability that he would have any spare
moments for eating or sleeping. The serious
aspect of the present condition of
popular knowledge, however, is the apparent
absence of desire upon the part
of many young people to grasp the principles
of natural science. I am not exaggerating
when I say that there are plenty
of fairly educated persons in every large
city who deny that man is an animal, and
who insist that a whale must be a fish, because
it lives in the sea.</p>
<p>Everybody professes to be aware in a
sort of unconscious way that the theory
of Evolution was invented by Mr. Darwin,
and patented by Mr. Spencer, the
most important points in the doctrine being
that all men are descended from monkeys
which had lost their tails, that the
fittest survived, and that there is a &ldquo;missing
link&rdquo; between man and his ancestors.</p>
<p>These ideas have little foundation in
fact. Darwin no more discovered Evolution
than Edison discovered electricity;
we are not descended from any existing
ape, with or without a tail, and no competent
person ever asserted that we were;
and there are good reasons for saying
that such palaeontological &ldquo;links&rdquo; as are
missing are not of the greatest possible
importance. In short, whatever is evolutionary
in the popular mind, is a burlesque
upon the evolutionist&rsquo;s true opinions.</p>
<p>Charles Darwin was born in 1809, on
the same day as Lincoln, but, long before
Darwin&rsquo;s time, evolution had become a
recognized force in science. Kant, who
lived from 1724 to 1804, and Laplace
(1749-1827) had worked out the development
of the sun and the planets from
white-hot gas. Lyell (1797-1875) had
worked out the evolution of the earth&rsquo;s
surface to its present condition; and Lamarck
(1744-1829) had shown that there
is evidence of the descent of all animals,
as well as all plants, from a few ancestors
by gradual modification. Again, Herbert
Spencer, during Darwin&rsquo;s lifetime,
began to work out the growth of mind
from the most simple beginnings to the
highest development of human thought.</p>
<p>The philosophies of the ancients were
all of them founded upon limited observation;
they were merely speculative
fancy-pictures evolved from the author&rsquo;s
own consciousness. Modern science,
however, is of quite a different character.
It has relegated certain fundamental
propositions to a region called &ldquo;the Unknowable&rdquo;
(this means at present unknowable),
and it permits everybody to
explain these propositions by means of
any hypotheses which may occur to him.
In other words, modern science does not
deal with such phenomena as are at the
present day outside the range of the human
intellect; and I venture to warn the
reader that speculation concerning matters
upon which we have as yet no scientific
data is waste of time. Modern science
is founded upon investigation and observation,
and the evidence is always weighed
as carefully and as impartially as are
the statements of witnesses in a law court.</p>
<p>One naturally asks: &ldquo;What is Evolution?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Continuous change according to
certain fixed laws,&rdquo; is a reply which may
have some value, although it is quite insufficient.
A technical definition, given
by Mr. Spencer, is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;An integration of matter and concomitant
dissipation of motion, during
which the matter passes from an indefinite,
incoherent heterogeneity, to a definite,
coherent homogeneity, and during
which the retained motion undergoes a
parallel transformation.&rdquo; Anybody who
will think about this definition will be able
to appreciate its meaning, provided a
good dictionary is at hand.</p>
<p>Evolution is not another word for Development,
and Mr. Spencer has carefully
distinguished the one from the
other; but the details are too technical for
notice in this paper. Evolution may be
regarded as &ldquo;a general term for the history
of the steps by which any living being
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
has acquired the morphological and
physiological characters which distinguish
it.&rdquo; Development is &ldquo;the process
of differentiation by which the primitively
similar parts of a living body become
more and more unlike one another.&rdquo; Both
definitions are Huxley&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The evolution of organic matter now
claims attention in detail. Of the origin
of first life, we know absolutely nothing.
The doctrine of Evolution does not deal
with that. There are, however, many hypotheses
upon the subject. Lord Kelvin,
the eminent physicist, has suggested that
unicellular life may have been transferred
to this globe from a wrecked planet. This
hypothesis obviously aids us very little,
for it merely transfers the original scene
of action to some other world. Personally,
I prefer the idea that the first protoplasm
was produced by the action of the
sun upon inorganic matter not unlike the
colloids, and that it &ldquo;fed upon the previous
steps in its own evolution.&rdquo; In this
connection, I may say that two points are
certain&mdash;viz., that vegetable life preceded
animal life, and that the first forms of life
were mere specks of jelly, without organs.
Can these primitive specks be
created at the present time? Or, in other
words, can protoplasm be manufactured
by artificial processes? The answer must
be No; not by any process now known,
although a great number of experiments
have been made with the object of manufacturing
unicellular vegetable life. During
the years between 1870 and 1880, this
question was thoroughly thrashed out,
and at first the balance seemed to be very
evenly held between the supporters and
the opponents of spontaneous generation.
The investigations of the late Professor
Tyndall, however, conclusively proved
that biogenesis, that is, all life from previous
life, is the condition at the present
day. But I must add Huxley&rsquo;s words of
warning, viz., &ldquo;that with organic chemistry,
molecular physics, and physiology
yet in their infancy, and every day making
prodigious strides, it would be the height
of presumption for any man to say that
the conditions under which matter assumes
the qualities called vital, may not
some day be artificially brought together.&rdquo;
And further, &ldquo;that as a matter not
of proof but of probability, if it were
given me to look beyond the abyss of
geologically recorded time, to the still
more remote period when the earth was
passing through chemical and physical
conditions which it can never see again,
I should expect to be a witness of the
evolution of living protoplasm from nonliving
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first protoplasm must be extremely
ancient, for the remains of sea-weeds
are found in the oldest strata, and vegetation
implies the manufacture of protoplasm
from inorganic matter.</p>
<p>When the earth was in the condition to
which Huxley referred, the constantly
decreasing heat, and the recurrence of
the seasons produced, by slow degrees,
changes in the congenital character of the
forms of life. Every individual varied
somewhat from its predecessors, and
those forms which possessed variations
most suitable to the environment were
the ones which eventually survived. The
transition from the protophyta, the lowest
class of vegetable life, to the protozoa,
the lowest class of animal life, must have
been a very simple matter in the condition
in which the earth then was. Indeed, today
the difference between the lowest microscopic
animals and the lowest microscopic
plants is by no means clearly defined.</p>
<p>Innumerable hosts of life made their
appearance upon our planet while the
surface was going through the cooling
process, and they were, at first, of course,
of the most primitive kind. But the same
laws were always at work, viz., no two
living things were exactly alike when
they made their appearance upon this
earth, although the differences between
several forms might be very slight. Variation
was, and is, the order of the day.</p>
<p>The individuals which possessed variations
in accordance with the environment
persisted, while those having injurious
variations had a tendency to disappear.
Congenital variations were (and are)
transmitted with great certainty. This is
Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Process of Natural Selection,&rdquo;
called by Mr. Spencer &ldquo;The Survival
of the Fittest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Darwinian factor in evolution
is Sexual Selection. It is that department
of Natural Selection in which sex is
especially concerned. Anything which
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
exhibits the prowess or beauty of the one
sex attracts the other, and decides the
preference for one individual over another,
with the result that those individuals
which are unattractive to the opposite
sex are unable to reproduce their
kind. The importance of this factor will
be appreciated if I give an extract from
Darwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Descent of Man&rdquo; (Vol. II., p.
367). &ldquo;For my own part,&rdquo; wrote our
great master, &ldquo;I conclude that of all the
causes which have led to the differences
in external appearance between the races
of men, and to a great extent between
man and the lower animals, sexual selection
must have been by far the most efficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I have already said, Darwin neither
invented nor discovered the doctrine of
Evolution. But he placed it upon a firm
foundation by the discovery of the two
great factors to which I have referred,
and, by incessant observation and indomitable
energy, he demonstrated the truth
of them beyond any reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>The proofs of the truth of Evolution
are of two kinds&mdash;palaeontological and
embryological. The palaeontological evidence
has found its way into popular
books, and even into some of the literary
newspapers. The history of the horses,
of the crocodiles, of the rhinoceros is
known in detail. All the stages have
been found which intervene between the
four-toed Eohippos of the Lower Eocene
and the zebra and horse of the present
day. Thanks to the late Professor Marsh,
of Yale, not only are the successive steps
in the evolution of the foot-structure preserved,
but so also are the various stages
in the evolution of the teeth. The occasional
appearance of a three-toed horse
points very plainly to a three-toed progenitor,
a striking example of atavism,
that is, the reappearance of a characteristic
which has &ldquo;skipped&rdquo; one or more generations.</p>
<p>If the principle of heredity be true, one
would expect to find in the development
of animals and plants, traces of the line of
descent. &ldquo;If Evolution be true, one
ought to find, following back the development
of the egg, that specific details
would vanish and give rise to more generalized
features; that the earlier the
stages, the more the embryos of related
forms would resemble each other.&rdquo; This
is exactly what is found, there being, in
a vast number of instances, a remarkable
parallel between the palaeontological
record and the embryological evidence. A
detailed examination of the facts would
not be intelligible to anybody who is not
a practical biologist; but I am fully warranted
in asserting that every organism in
the course of its life-history (technically
called ontogeny) is a recapitulation of the
history of the race&mdash;technically known as
phylogeny.</p>
<p>There is other evidence in abundance.
The phenomena named atavism is a part
of that evidence. Almost everybody has
seen well-defined and regular stripes
upon horses, and nobody doubts that
they indicate a zebra-like ancestor.
Again, in the inner side of the human
eye is a little red fold, known as the plica
semilunaris, the remnant of an ancestor
which possessed a third eyelid, similar to
that possessed by some reptiles and birds
of to-day.</p>
<p>Who are the supporters of the doctrine
of Evolution? Practically the whole
scientific world. The late Professor
Marsh, the distinguished palaeontologist,
when president of the American Association
for the Advance of Science in 1878,
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need offer no argument for Evolution,
since to doubt evolution is to doubt
science, and science is only another name
for the truth.&rdquo; Professor Marsh meant,
of course, not that evolution is to be taken
&ldquo;on trust,&rdquo; but that it has been so thoroughly
proved that new arguments in
support of it are unnecessary.</p>
<p>Concerning Natural Selection, sometimes
called Darwinism, the late Professor
Huxley said (quotation from Darwin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Life&rdquo;): &ldquo;I venture to affirm that
so far as all my knowledge goes, all the ingenuity
and all the learning of the hostile
critics have not enabled them to adduce
a single fact of which it can be said this is
irreconcilable with the Darwinian
theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I occasionally hear the old argument
that species are immutable&mdash;that a species
is something which never changes. It
seems a little late in the day to revive this
contention, but it is necessary to be prepared
with a reply. The critics of Darwin&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
theory of &ldquo;the Origin of Species by
Natural Selection&rdquo; have always refused
to give a tangible definition of the word
&ldquo;species,&rdquo; and, as a result, the real difficulty
turns upon that point. What is a
species? Linnaeus said: &ldquo;There are as
many species as an infinite Being created
at the beginning,&rdquo; a statement which is
a confession of faith, and not a scientific
definition. We must remember, of
course, that Linnaeus died as long ago as
1778. The truth is that all the various
tests for species have proved faulty, that
of the fertility of hybrids having little
more value than many of the other so-called
&ldquo;tests.&rdquo; In classification, the
word &ldquo;species&rdquo; means the lowest subdivision
to which a name is usually applied,
and to aid the zoologist&rsquo;s or botanist&rsquo;s
memory, some system of classification is,
I need not say, an absolute necessity.</p>
<p>According to the view of the anti-evolutionists,
most of whom are not scientific
men, descendants of a common ancestor
must belong to the same species. Nevertheless,
the late Mr. Romanes has shown
that the rabbits of Porto Santo, an island
in the Atlantic, about twenty-five miles
from Madeira, descended from the European
stock of nearly 500 years ago, will
no longer breed with their continental
cousins.</p>
<p>When we remember that some wild
animals will not breed in captivity, the
idea of sterility as a test of species seems
utterly unscientific. I venture to say that
there can be no accurate definition of
species in terms of physiology, for every
individual has its peculiarities, chemical
as well as physical, and the real difficulty
is to decide when these peculiarities are
important enough to make it useful to
give a precise name to their possessors.
Assume for a moment that a species is a
group of individuals agreeing in essential
characters which remain constant from
one generation to another. But what are
essential characters and how much constancy
is demonstrated? Upon these
points no two biologists are likely to
agree. For example, taking the birds of
Germany, Bechstein says there are 367
species; Brehm says there are 900. According
to Reichenbach there are 379,
and Meyer and Wolf tell us there are 406.</p>
<p>The idea of a species is based upon
structural resemblances between individuals,
and the degree of importance attached
to these depends upon the mind of
the particular observer.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why nobody has
seen one species turn into another. The
first is that until the word &ldquo;species&rdquo; is
satisfactorily defined, instances of the
evolution of new forms cannot be supplied.
Secondly, as nobody lives much
beyond a hundred years at the most&mdash;a
mere moment in Nature&mdash;our ability to
witness marked changes in animals or
plants is extremely limited. Minor
changes, of course, are frequently noticed.
I ask the reader to remember,
however, that the flower-garden and the
farm-yard are in an artificial condition,
Natural Selection having ceased. For
instance, the duck which has defective
wings when hatched has as good a chance
of surviving as the duck with powerful
wings.</p>
<p>Who are the opponents of the doctrine
of Evolution? In the scientific world
they are difficult to find. Professor Virchow,
of Berlin, the distinguished pathologist
must, I think, be classed as one, although
his verdict is really &ldquo;not proven.&rdquo;
Professor Haeckel, however, has pointed
out that the opinion of a pathologist, no
matter how eminent, upon the subject of
evolution cannot carry much weight.</p>
<p>Until recently we had with us two men
of science whose opposition to some portion
of the doctrine of evolution was of
importance. These men were Sir William
Dawson, the Canadian geologist, and
Mr. Mivart, the English anatomist. Both
of these gentlemen have died within the
past two years.</p>
<p>Having now written a brief outline of
the doctrine of Evolution, I believe that I
cannot do better than conclude this very
imperfect sketch with a quotation from
the immortal Shakespeare:</p>

<p class="caption">SURF SCOTER.
<br />(Oidemia perspicillata).
<br />About &frac12; Life-size.
<br /><span class="small">FROM COL. CHI. ACAD. SCIENCES.</span></p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c10">THE SURF SCOTER.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Oidemia perspicillata.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Surf Scoter is also known by several
other popular names, such as the
Surf Duck, the Surf or Sea Coot and, not
infrequently, the Booby. The name Velvet
Duck, though more commonly applied
to the white-winged scoter, is also
sometimes used to designate this species.</p>
<p>This Scoter is an American species
and is only an accidental visitor to European
coasts. Its range includes the
&ldquo;coasts and larger inland waters of northern
North America; in winter, south to
Florida, to the Ohio River and to San
Quentin Bay, Lower California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our illustration is that of a male bird.
The female is a sooty brown, silvery gray
below and with much white on the sides
of the head.</p>
<p>Immense flocks of the young of this
species winter on San Diego Bay, California.
Here the adult birds are of rather
rare occurrence for they are able to withstand
the rigors of an arctic winter and
stay far to the northward where they are
a common resident. In the vicinity of
San Diego there was about one adult to
every seventy-five or one hundred juvenile
birds. The former may be easily distinguished
by their very striking velvety
black plumage, the white markings on
the nape and forehead standing out in
bold contrast. These white markings remind
one of the white bull&rsquo;s eye on a target.
Because of this striking color characteristic
the Surf Scoter is frequently
called the Target Head, by the California
hunters.</p>
<p>They are wary birds and it is often necessary
to make a long detour in order to
reach a spot near to a flock, without attracting
their attention, as they ride the
crest of the waves in a heavy surf. The
younger birds will remain in the surf so
close to the shore that frequently they are
cast high and dry upon the beach. When
this happens it is very amusing to watch
them awkwardly scramble back and enter
the water again. The older birds are usually
much more shy, remaining far out
on the water where they congregate in
pairs, though sometimes there may be
six or eight together.</p>
<p>As the tides enter San Diego Bay they
carry in the loose seaweeds in which are
entangled numerous dead starfish and
other forms of marine life. These form
the principal food not only of the Scoters
but also of all the water fowls, such as
other species of ducks, the cormorant, the
pelican and the beautiful California gull.</p>
<p>The note of the Surf Scoter is to me
the most pleasing of all the ducks. It is
a soft, mellow whistle ending in a cluck!
cluck!</p>
<p>Mr. Nelson states that the Surf Scoter
appears in the vicinity of St. Michaels,
Alaska, about the middle of May and
nests commonly in the marshes of the
delta of the Yukon river. It also nests in
large numbers on the Atlantic coast from
Labrador northward.</p>
<p>Dr. Coues, speaking of these birds as
he observed them in Labrador, says,
&ldquo;They are tough birds and remarkably
tenacious of life and require a heavy
charge to kill them. They are known as
Bottle-nosed Coots, a name given in allusion
to the very peculiar shape and color
of the bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its nest, usually placed on grassy
knolls, in fresh-water marshes near the
sea, is made of dried weeds and grasses
and lined with the down of the bird. It
is evident that the female performs all the
duties of incubating the eggs and carrying
for the young, for during the nesting
period large flocks are observable that
consist entirely of males, constantly feeding
in their accustomed haunts.</p>
<p>This ocean duck feeds &ldquo;on small mollusks
and fishes, for which it dives almost
constantly, both in the sandy bays and
amidst the tumbling surf, sometimes fishing
at the depth of several fathoms and
floating buoyantly among the surf of the
raging billows, where it seems as unconcerned
as if it were on the most tranquil
waters.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c11">A BACK-YARD CLASS.</h2>
<p>The Farnum&rsquo;s back-yard was something
disagreeable. Still it didn&rsquo;t matter
much, thought the children, as long
as the front yard was nicely kept and
there was a high fence all around the
back. Besides, Mr. Farnum was away
from home traveling all the week; Mrs.
Farnum was so busy that she hardly ever
saw the disreputable yard, and the children,
Rob, Lora and Baby Jim, liked best
to play away from home.</p>
<p>At last it dawned on the mother&rsquo;s mind
that they were hardly ever at home except
to eat and to sleep and to get ready
to go away again and she began to worry
about it and wonder what she should do.</p>
<p>That very day Rob came running in
to show a bug which he had in a bottle.
It was such a queer looking specimen
that all became interested in it at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it till papa comes back, he&rsquo;ll
be sure to know!&rdquo; exclaimed Rob
proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is only Tuesday, my boy.
You can&rsquo;t keep it in that bottle all the
week without food or drink. It must
not be left to starve,&rdquo; Mrs. Farnum replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find it something to eat,&rdquo; cried
the children, and off they ran.</p>
<p>But this was not such an easy matter.
Mr. Bug would not touch any of the
back-yard &ldquo;vegetables,&rdquo; as Rob called
the variety of weeds that clung to the rotten
fence boards or matted the ground of
the large garden. In spite of their efforts
the bug stuck to the corner of the
bottle and refused to be comforted, with
food, at least. At last, in despair, Rob
ran to the drug store and asked what he
could give the bug to &ldquo;make it die a
peaceful death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just put a layer of pyrethrum in the
bottom of your bottle,&rdquo; answered the
druggist, &ldquo;keep it corked tight, and you
can make every bug in your yard die
happy. Pyrethrum is a powder that is
harmless to people (though of course you
must not eat it), but the least smell of it
kills insects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rob went home delighted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make
a collection of bugs, as Sam Ward does
of butterflies,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d help you if it wasn&rsquo;t for those horrid
spiders,&rdquo; said Lora. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid as
death of them ever since I read about a
baby dying from a spider-bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! Only a few spiders are poisonous,
that is, I think so. Let&rsquo;s get a
library book about them and find out;
then may be we&rsquo;ll have a spider collection,
too,&rdquo; answered the practical brother.</p>
<p>While Rob was getting his bottles
ready in which to &ldquo;electrocute&rdquo; the bugs
and Lora was going to the library after
the books, Mrs. Farnum was rummaging
in the attic. At last she came down
bearing triumphantly aloft a big old-fashioned
work-box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This you may have for a specimen
case,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll fit some little
drawers in it, Rob, I&rsquo;ll line them with
scraps of velvet and have a glass top put
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children set to work at once, and
in vain the neighbors&rsquo; children whistled
for them on the other side of the high
board fence. Lora took the hammock
from the front lawn to swing beneath the
old apple tree. But the tall weeds
reached up to the hammock, so Rob had
to go for the old scythe rusting in the
fence corner and Baby Jim came dragging
a hoe with which to cut them down.
Soon they had a large space cleared under
and around the apple trees, and when
it was carefully raked and swept they ran
in to beg their mother for some porch
chairs for their &ldquo;summer parlor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Rob made for himself a camp-stool
that he could carry around and
plant among the bushes where he would
sit watching for certain bugs to appear
and trying to catch them in his bottle.
Such patience as it took at first! And
how little Rob had of it! But Lora read
long, interesting chapters to him out of
&ldquo;The Insect World,&rdquo; and the specimen
case grew so fast and became so fascinating
that he found the patience quite
worth while.</p>
<p>Whatever Rob did, of course, Baby
Jim wanted to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ant-hill&rsquo;s mine! I &rsquo;scovered it!&rdquo;
he announced at supper one evening.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a fence wound it to keep the
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
wolves out, and I&rsquo;ll have the ants for my
sheepses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Farnum did not look as pleased
as the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the ants crawling all
over you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they won&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;ll take my red chair
out and sit on it, like Rob does,&rdquo; he
answered, solemnly.</p>
<p>The next day he set to work to build
a big circular fence around his ant hill,
working as perseveringly as ever any
real shepherd did to get his fold ready,
and accepting no help from Rob except
allowing him to shave up a board to furnish
the &ldquo;palings.&rdquo; Then, day after
day, while Lora swung in the hammock
reading aloud to Rob, little Jim sat
perched on his red chair herding his
ant-flock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feed them and they eat, but they
never drink a tiny bit,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ants find their drink away down
in the ground, dear,&rdquo; replied his mother.
&ldquo;Now tell me what you have learned
about your sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned a greedy lesson to-day,&rdquo; said
Baby Jim. &ldquo;One ant had some food
and he met an ant who hadn&rsquo;t any, and
he divided; then he went on some more
and met another ant with not any, and
he told him to come over to my chair-leg
where the cookie was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The family all laughed, and still more
at Rob, who asked, &ldquo;Is Jim going to be
an ant-hropologist, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered Mr. Farnum.
&ldquo;Now, children, I have something nice
to tell you. I have hired a man to come
and help us improve the back-yard. He
will cut the weeds and trim up the trees
and bushes, and we can plan the walks
and flower-beds for next spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lovely!&rdquo; cried Lora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Rob,
with an ugly pucker in his forehead. &ldquo;It
will scare all my bugs away. They like
weeds and dirty places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted his papa, &ldquo;but next
spring you will have to go to the woods
for new specimens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t scare my specimens away,&rdquo;
laughed Lora. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been studying
birds lately. You see when I become
tired of reading I just lie back in the
hammock and watch the birds in the
tree-tops. They are so very smart, and
they do the queerest things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the plan to improve the yard suited
all but Baby Jim, who wailed long and
loud because his ant city would be destroyed.
In vain did the family try to
comfort him. He could not be persuaded
to abandon his flock.</p>
<p>That night, to Jim&rsquo;s distress, a cold
rainfall set in. &ldquo;My sheeps will all be
dwounded,&rdquo; he wailed! &ldquo;I meant to
make a &rsquo;bwella over them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Lora, drawing him
up to the sofa beside her. &ldquo;This is the
picture of the inside of an ant-hill.
Here is the top door where you see the
ants go in, then they go down to this
large room, then sideways to this one,
then down, down, down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baby Jim&rsquo;s eyes opened very wide.
He seized the book and studied the drawing
long and earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sheep are all down in the rooms
now, having a nice Sunday, I think,&rdquo; continued
Lora. &ldquo;When winter comes and
the snow is all over the ground they won&rsquo;t
come up at all. Haven&rsquo;t you seen them
carrying food in to pile up in one of their
rooms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, and my cookies are all down
there!&rdquo; he cried in great delight.</p>
<p>When the man appeared in the morning
Baby Jim marched out with an air
of importance, and, after surveying the
deserted ant-hill, he turned to the man
and said, &ldquo;My sheeps are all gone into
the house to bed, so you can clean up
their meadow if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus it was that the Farnum children
began a study which will interest
them as long as they live. There is no
longer any need to worry about their living
at the neighbors; and at last the
Farnum back-yard has become not only
respectable, but actually a &ldquo;thing of
beauty and joy forever.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c12">THE AMERICAN ELK OR WAPITI.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Cervus canadensis.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Centuries ago, before Columbus sailed
the unknown seas which divided him
from the New World of his dreams and
ambitions, before the birth of De Soto,
that adventurer whose discoveries and
conquests were to unfold to the Old
World the mysteries and fascinations of
the new land, through the virgin forest
and over the broad plains as yet unknown
to the white race, roamed many animals
which were widely distributed throughout
North America.</p>
<p>They fearlessly sought those localities
which would furnish them the most
abundant supply of food and water. Unmolested
except by their natural enemies,
they multiplied and lived a free and untrammeled
life.</p>
<p>In these early times the Wapiti or the
American Elk, as it is commonly though
erroneously called, was probably the most
widely distributed quadruped in North
America. Its range extended from the
northern part of Mexico northward to
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay and from the Atlantic to
the Pacific Ocean. At the present time,
however, but a few wild individuals are
left in the United States east of the Mississippi
and lower Missouri Rivers.
They are occasionally met with in the
wilder regions bordering Lake Superior,
and it is reported that they are still living
in the mountainous regions of Pennsylvania
and Virginia. The advance of
civilization, causing the cultivation of
the lands and the destruction of the forests,
has gradually driven this noble animal
to the westward and into the wilds
of British America. In the states bordering
the Pacific Ocean and along the
western tributaries of the Mississippi
and the Missouri rivers it is still quite
common. One writer tells us that &ldquo;in
the rich pasture lands of the San Joaquin
and Sacramento it formerly was to be
seen in immense droves and with the antelope,
the black-tailed deer, the wild cattle
and mustangs covered those plains
with herds rivalling those of the bison
east of the mountains or of the antelope in
South Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name Wapiti is of Indian origin,
and in their language is used to designate
a Rock Mountain goat. The name
elk so commonly applied to this animal
should properly be limited to the moose.</p>
<p>The Wapiti is closely related and belongs
to the same genus as the famous
stag or red deer (Cervus elaphus) of
Europe. This animal, which is smaller
than the Wapiti, inhabits the forests of
mountainous regions.</p>
<p>In both the Wapiti and the stag the
senses of sight, hearing and smell are
well developed. They will detect a
human being or other animal when some
distance away. Though their acute
senses protect them, they are said to have
poor memories as well as weak powers
of comprehension. The Wapiti when
listening raises its head and throws forward
its erected ears. When entering
the forest it will examine the surrounding
open country and sniff the wind,
seeking possible danger.</p>
<p>The antlers of both Wapiti and stag
are much alike, though those of the
former are longer and heavier, corresponding
to its larger size. The full
growth of the horns is attained about the
seventh year. The perfect horns are
slightly oval in transverse section and
thickly covered with warts or slight elevations,
which are arranged in longitudinal
lines. All the branches or prongs
are situated on the front side of the main
trunk. &ldquo;The general color is a light
chestnut red, which deepens into a
brownish hue on the neck and legs and
almost into a black on the throat and
along the median line of the under surface
of the body. The buttocks are yellowish
white, bordered by a dusky band
which extends down the posterior surface
of the hind legs.&rdquo; In winter the fur is
much thicker and finer and the general
color is more gray than in summer.
&ldquo;During the mating season the males
have fierce combats, and at this time the
male Wapiti emits a peculiar noise, resembling
the braying of an ass, beginning
with a loud shrill tone and ending in a
deep guttural note.&rdquo; At this time, even
when kept in confinement, the male is
easily irritated and may attack people.
Old males will frequently wage persistent
and long battles for supremacy. The
antlers are used as the weapons in these
duels, and cases have been recorded
where these have become so firmly interlocked
that they could not be separated,
resulting in the death of both individuals.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">

<p class="caption">AMERICAN ELK OR WAPITI.
<br />(Cervus canadensis).</p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>When food is plentiful and the Wapiti
is not constantly disturbed, it will remain
in the same region, only straying
away during the mating season. They
assemble in herds of a greater or less
number of individuals. The females
and fawns usually remain together; the
older females without fawns form another
herd and the old males, as a rule, lead
a more or less solitary life, except during
the mating season.</p>
<p>The Wapiti is more common in low
grounds in the vicinity of marshes and
well wooded tracts, where it feeds on
grasses and the young branches and
leaves of the willows and allied trees.</p>
<p>The Wapiti is graceful and proud in
its bearing and very light in its movements.
This is especially true of the
male, which may be described as an animal
of &ldquo;noble carriage.&rdquo; When moving
from place to place it walks rapidly
and runs with remarkable swiftness.</p>
<h2 id="c13">A FRIENDLY FIELD MOUSE.</h2>
<p>Many stories have been told in the past,
tending to show that wild animals when
in trouble will display surprising confidence
in man, in fact will often seek his
assistance when sore beset. The writer,
when a boy upon a farm in Minnesota,
had an experience with a field mouse
which prettily illustrates this trait in wild
creatures. It was stacking time and the
men were all busy in the fields lifting the
shocks of cured grain and stacking them
in hive-shaped stacks in the barnyard.
The writer, a barefoot boy at that time,
had been following the wagons in the
field all the morning in a vain endeavor to
capture some field mice to take home as
pets. He had seen a number of the drab
little creatures with their short tails, but
had failed to lay his hands upon any of
them, owing to the thick stubble and the
nimbleness of the mice. At last, as a particularly
large shock was lifted, a broken
nest was disclosed and the youthful
mouser was put upon the qui vive by the
slender squeaks of seven or eight hairless
little beings that were so young as not to
have opened their eyes as yet. The mother
disappeared with a whisk, whereupon
the young hunter sat down in a critical
attitude beside the nest and began to examine
his find. He had already put one
of the young mice in his trousers pocket
when the mother reappeared out of the
stubble beside the nest. The boy held his
breath and awaited developments. Much
to his surprise, the mouse-mother, after
carefully examining the ruined nest, entered
his pocket, which, as he sat, opened
very near to the nest. She seemed to come
to the conclusion very quickly that her
lost little one had found a very good
home, and in about two minutes had
transferred the remainder of her offspring
from the nest to the pocket, carrying
them one at a time in her mouth.</p>
<p>The writer has had many varied experiences
with wild animals, but none of
them impressed him so strongly as the
episode of the mouse-mother in the
wheat stubble.</p>

<h2 id="c14">THE OPENING OF WINTER BUDS.</h2>
<p>In our cold temperate zone spring
means chiefly the changing of the trees
from their naked winter condition to the
beautiful green leafy appearance of early
summer. When stripped of their foliage,
trees present to the observant eye a great
variety of form. The tall, slender poplar
can easily be distinguished from the
spreading elm as far as it is seen; as, also,
can the rough-barked hickory, with its
clinging strips of bark, from the smooth
beech.</p>
<p>Usually, the opening of buds seems to
take place almost in a single night, but
they really open very gradually. Now,
these buds are all formed the summer before,
but they are so small that they are
scarcely noticed in the midst of the many
leaves. In the winter, however, they are
readily seen; and, then, when the first
warm rains fall in the spring they start to
swell, and gradually grow larger until,
suddenly, they burst through their snug
winter coats, and show the tiny, green
leaves that have been concealed in the
thick, dark, outer covering.</p>
<p>The buckeye bud is one of the largest
of the winter buds. It is covered with
small, pointed, brown scales, which overlap
each other, thus keeping the cold
from the more delicate parts within. Underneath
these hard outer scales are thinner,
half-transparent ones. Their color
is a delicate pink, and fine veins line them.
Snugly wrapped inside these dainty coats
are tiny woolly objects, and when the wool
is removed they are found to be miniature
leaves folded together so compactly that
they occupy very little room. If the bud
has grown on the end of the twig a very
small flower bud will be enclosed within
the leaves; but if it has grown on the side
there will be no flower bud. Since these
leaves and flowers have all been formed
the summer before, it is easy to understand
that a few warm days will cause
them to grow so that they soon become
too large for their winter covering, and
suddenly burst it open.</p>
<p>The trees are forced into a period of
inactivity by the cold, so, if a twig is
broken off, and placed in moderately
warm water, in a warm, light place, the
buds on it will open just as they do in the
spring and their development may be
easily watched.</p>
<p>Often a tree will have a countless number
of buds; and since growing buds need
much light and nourishment only the
stronger ones will grow, the weaker ones
remaining in a resting state. These resting
buds are called dormant buds, the
word dormant coming from the Latin
word &ldquo;dormio,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;to sleep.&rdquo;
The buds often continue in this dormant
state for several years, becoming weaker
and weaker all the time, until finally they
die. If, however, the stronger buds are
killed at any time, as by a late frost, the
dormant ones suddenly become active,
and grow to take the place of the ones
that were destroyed. This shows us how
cleverly trees provide substitutes for
cases of emergency. These dormant
buds then might even be compared to the
understudies of the stage.</p>
<p>The regular places for buds to grow
are in the axes of the leaves or on the
end of the twigs. Buds, however, can be
made to grow on unusual places. If the
tops of the tree are cut off, as we often see
them in the maple, buds will grow on the
trunks. Then, if trees are cut down or
blown over, buds will grow on the
stumps or from the roots.</p>
<p>Thus, we can see by watching the formation
and development of buds, and the
growth of branches, that trees follow certain
fixed laws of nature, modifying these
laws only on account of some peculiar external
conditions as, for example, nourishment,
light, heat or moisture.</p>

<h2 id="c16">THE NAUTILUS AND OTHER CEPHALOPODS.</h2>
<p>The highest group of mollusks belongs
to the class Cephalopoda, which signifies
head-footed, the name being given to
them because the head is surrounded by
a circle of eight or ten arms, which act
both as arms and feet. Let us take as an
example of this class the common squid
of the Atlantic coast (Ommastrephes illecebrosa),
and see how it is formed. The
body is long and cylindrical and ends at
the tail in a point; the dorsal side of the
tail end has a pair of triangular fins. The
body is practically a hollow cylinder or
sac which contains the vital organs of the
animal. The neck is in many genera fastened
to this cylinder or mantle by an
apparatus which may be likened to a button
and button-hole. The head is rounded,
has on either side the large, round
eyes, and at the end it is split up into ten
arms, two of which are longer than the
others and are called the tentacular arms.
On the inner side, the arms are provided
with two rows of suckers, which are little,
rounded cups placed on pedicels or stems
and which form a vacuum when they
touch an object and so cling to it. The
two long arms are expanded and club-shaped
at the end, each club being armed
with four rows of suckers. Directly in
the center of the circle of arms the mouth
is placed and is provided with two sharp
beaks like those of a parrot, only inverted.
In addition to these organs there is a
large siphon or tube on the ventral side,
which is really an organ of locomotion,
for it expels water from the mantle cavity
with great force, thus rapidly sending the
animal backward, its usual direction of
propulsion. The body has no shell for
protection, but in its place there is a long
rod called a pen, which acts as a backbone
to support the body of the animal,
although of course not in the same sense
as the backbone of vertebrated animals.
In some cephalopods this pen is hard and
stiff but in Ommastrephes it is thin and
soft. Such is the general form of a cephalopod,
familiar names of which are the
Octopus, Squid, Nautilus, Paper-nautilus
and Devil-fish. In this class, also, the
majority of the shelled species are extinct,
only a few living at the present time.
The Ammonite is an example of the extinct
cephalopods.</p>
<p>The most familiar member of this class
to the layman is the Pearly Nautilus, the
shell of which may be found on the mantel
shelf or what-not of very many dwellings.
The shell of the Nautilus is formed
in a spiral and is made up of many chambers,
all connected by a tube called a siphuncle,
the outer chamber containing
the animal and hence called the living
chamber. The shell is called the &ldquo;Pearly
Nautilus,&rdquo; but the pearly tints cannot be
seen until the outer layer&mdash;which is yellowish-white
with brown markings&mdash;is
taken off, when the exquisite, rainbow-like
colors may be observed.</p>
<p>While the shell of Nautilus is well
known the animal is very rare in our museums,
although the natives of the Fiji
Islands, New Hebrides and New Caledonia
are able to obtain it in large quantities
for food and it is highly esteemed by
them. During the voyage of H. M. S.
Challenger around the world, a living
Nautilus was captured by dredging in
some three hundred and twenty fathoms
near Mateeka Island, one of the Fiji
group. This was placed in a tub and it
swam about in a lively manner by ejecting
water from its funnel. The tentacles,
of which there are a larger number than
in the other cephalopods, were spread out
radially, like those of the sea anemone.
The Nautilus lives among the coral reefs,
at depths varying from three to three
hundred fathoms or more.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">

<br />PAPER NAUTILUS.
<br />(Argonauta tuberculata).
<br />PEARLY NAUTILUS.
<br />(Nautilus umbilicatus).
<br /><span class="small">FROM COL. CHI. ACAD. SCIENCES.</span></p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>The Fijian&rsquo;s method of capturing the
Nautilus for food is thus described (Tryon,&mdash;Structural
and Systematic Conchology):
&ldquo;When the water is smooth so that
the bottom, at several fathoms&rsquo; depth, near
the border of the reef, may be distinctly
seen, the fisherman in his little, frail
canoe scrutinizes the sands and the coral
masses below, to discover the animal in
its favorite haunts. The experienced eye
of the native may probably encounter it
in its usual position, clinging to some
prominent ledge, with the shell turned
downwards. The tackle consists first, of
a large, round, wicker-work basket,
shaped very much like a cage rat-trap,
having an opening above, with a circlet of
points directed inward, so as to permit of
entry but to preclude escape; secondly, a
rough piece of rope of sufficient length to
reach the bottom; and lastly, a small
piece of branched wood, with the
branches sharpened to form a sort of
grapnel, to which a perforated stone is attached,
answering the purpose of a sinker.
The basket is now weighted with
stones, well baited with boiled cray-fish
(the principal food of the Nautilus is
crabs of different species), and then
dropped gently down near the victim.
The trap is now either closely watched or
a mark is placed upon the spot, and the
fisherman pursues his avocation upon
other parts of the reef until a certain
period has elapsed, when he returns and
in all probability finds the Nautilus in his
cage, feeding upon the bait. The grapnel
is now carefully let down, and having
entered the basket through the opening
on top, a dextrous movement of the hand
fixes one or more of the points or hooks
and the prize is safely hoisted into the
canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The animal is made into soup by some
of the natives while others boil it in a pot.
The shells are used by the natives to
make beautifully carved figures, the contrast
of the dark outer coating against the
light, pearly, inner coating producing a
striking effect. The shell is also used in
England and on the Continent to produce
elegant cameos.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Argonaut,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Paper Sailor,&rdquo; is
no less beautiful and interesting than the
Pearly Nautilus. The thin and fragile
shell cannot be compared with that of the
Nautilus nor with the pen, or internal
support, of the squid, for it is attached to
the animal by no muscles, and is only kept
in position by the broad webs on the upper
arms of the female (which alone possesses
a shell), its function being simply
to protect the eggs. The male is very
much smaller than the female and is exceedingly
rare. The natural position of
the female is with its arms spread out and
hanging about the shell, four in front and
four behind, the two broad arms supporting
the shell being spread out and closely
embracing the latter. The siphon is
turned toward the ridged part of the shell
and the animal progresses in a backward
direction by forcibly ejecting water
through this organ. It crawls with the
shell on its back, like a snail.</p>
<p>The poets have given us many beautiful
writings detailing the vices and virtues
of the lower forms of life and among these
the Pearly Nautilus and Paper Sailor
have received a goodly share of the
muse&rsquo;s attention. But, alas! for the poet,
who, not being a conchologist, has sadly
misused and misjudged these helpless and
harmless creatures. Thus we are told
how the paper nautilus sails over the
ocean with his &ldquo;sails&rdquo; (meaning the two
expanded arms) spread out to catch the
breeze, and how, when the storm approaches,
it folds its sails and disappears
beneath the waters of the ocean. Alas
for the poet! he puts the most beautiful
ideas together in verse, ideas and themes
which we would fain believe; but along
comes cold, calculating science, and at
one fell stroke sweeps away all that the
poet has done, for in the poem on the Argonaut
all is wrong, the animal does not
and could not sail, for were it to do so
the shell would fall and become lost in
the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>A mollusk whose shell is cast upon the
shore by thousands, but the animal of
which is very rare, is the Spirula. The
shell is less than an inch in diameter, is
made in the form of a loose spiral and is
divided into little chambers connected by
a siphuncle. The shell of this genus does
not contain the animal, as in Nautilus, but
it is enveloped in two flaps of the mantle,
at the posterior part of the animal, the
shell being concealed with the exception
of a part of the edge on each side. The
body of the animal is long and cylindrical
and the arms are quite short, more nearly
resembling those of the Nautilus than
those of the Octopus or squid. The body
ends in a disk which is supposed to be a
kind of sucker, by which the animal can
adhere to rocks, thus enabling it to freely
use its arms in obtaining food. It has
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
been supposed by some anatomists that
the shells of the fossil Ammonites were
attached to the animal in a similar manner,
and if this should be true these small
mollusks would assume a new meaning
as being the last survivors of a large
group of animals of which all except
Spirula are extinct.</p>
<p>Probably the best known of the shell-less
cephalopods is the octopus, with its
rounded body, large eyes and long arms.
Almost everybody has read Victor
Hugo&rsquo;s weird account of the octopus in
his &ldquo;Toilers of the Sea,&rdquo; and the animal
has thus been rendered more or less familiar,
although it was made to do several
things by the author that it would
not do in nature, as, for example, &ldquo;drinking&rdquo;
a man alive. The Octopus is found
abundantly throughout temperate and
tropical seas, generally on the coast
among rocks, but frequently on the sandy
bottom in water of moderate depth. Here
it may occasionally be seen &ldquo;walking&rdquo;
clumsily along on its eight long arms, its
little round body being balanced above
the arms. Its favorite position, however,
is among the rocks. In such a locality
it will squeeze its body into some crevice
and spread out its arms until they form a
sort of web, resembling in this position a
huge spider waiting for its prey. And it
may well be likened to a spider for from
this web there is no escape if once a hapless
fish has come in contact with the
powerful suckers on the long arms. The
poor fish is paralyzed when seized by the
octopus and is drawn towards the mouth,
where it is torn to pieces by the beak-like
jaws, and swallowed.</p>
<p>Like many of the mollusks of which
we have written the octopus is esteemed
as a valuable article of food by several
savage tribes as well as by some civilized
people. The native of the Pacific coast
catches the Octopus (Octopus punctatus)
by a very ingenious method. Providing
himself with a spear twelve or fourteen
feet long which has four or five barbed
pieces of hard wood some fourteen inches
long attached to the end, he paddles his
canoe to the feeding-ground of the mollusk.
One is soon found in ten or twelve
feet of water and the Indian carefully lets
down his spear until within a few inches
of the center of the animal, when he
quickly plunges it into the soft mass. Instantly
the water is in commotion, the
eight long arms writhing about in an endeavor
to reach the boat. The Indian
knows that should this happen his
chances for life would be slim indeed. But
he is prepared, and carefully lifting up the
octopus with his barbed spear until it is
above the surface of the water, he plunges
a long, sharp spear, with which he is provided,
into each arm where it joins the
body. At each plunge of the spear, an
arm becomes helpless and in a short time
the animal, which but a few moments before
had the power of a score of men, lies
in the canoe, a shapeless, helpless mass.</p>
<p>That the octopus is good eating the
writer can attest from experience, for
during a visit to Yucatan some years ago
this mollusk was served as a meat dish
and was very palatable, the flesh being
firm and tender and much resembling
chicken. The portion which fell to the
writer was the head, with a part of the
arms attached.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting characteristics
of the Octopi and allied cephalopods
is their facility for changing color when
danger is near. These changes are caused
by little pigment cells just beneath the
skin, which expand and contract. Thus,
if a person is looking at an octopus in
captivity and the animal is so placed that
it cannot escape, the observer will be astonished
to see the body of the animal
suddenly assume a deep pinkish color
which in turn is succeeded by a blue and
then by a green, and finally a return to
pink. The body is covered with these little
pigment cells, the different colors&mdash;pink,
blue and green&mdash;being so evenly
scattered over the surface than when each
color cell is expanded the whole body assumes
that tinge. This is one of the most
wonderful characteristics of the Mollusca.</p>
<p>Another cephalopod closely related to
the Octopus is the Squid, several species
of which are found on the Atlantic coast
of the United States. In this genus the
body is long and cylindrical, ends in two
fins, has a prominent head terminating in
eight short and two long arms and is supported
by a long, cartilaginous, internal
pen, which is made up of a central shaft
with expansions on each side like a quill,
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
hence the name &ldquo;pen.&rdquo; These animals are
very numerous in individuals and form a
large part of the food of fishes, like the
blue-fish, black bass, etc., and have even
been found in the stomach of jelly-fishes.
Besides being eaten by the fish the squid
furnishes a large part of the food of some
whales, the former occurring frequently
in shoals and falling ready victims to the
huge monster.</p>
<p>In Norway and Sweden the people
have a legend of a peculiar sea-monster,
called the Kraken, which was probably
founded on some of the enormous squids
discovered during the past thirty years.
Many of these mollusks are found off the
coasts of Norway, Scotland and Ireland,
and not a few have been recorded from
the coasts of Nova Scotia and New England.
In the larger of these animals the
body is eight or ten feet long, the short
arms eight feet and the long, tentacular
arms thirty feet in length, making in all
an animal nearly forty feet long when
fully stretched out! The squid is greatly
prized as bait and frequently a royal battle
will take place between one of these
gigantic creatures and a boat&rsquo;s crew. Sad
indeed is the fate of the latter if the mollusk
once gets a firm hold of the boat.
Care is used, however, to guard against
such a result, and the animal is gradually
deprived of its strength by making a sudden
dash, cutting off an arm and as quickly
retreating. These large squids are not
as common as the smaller ones and they
are rarely captured.</p>
<p>An ingenious method of capturing a
species of the smaller squids (Ommastrephes
illecebrosa) in use by the fishermen
of the New England coast is as follows:
The squid has the habit of swimming in
an opposite direction to a light, as the
full moon, so the fishermen go out to sea
in boats, light a large torch in each boat
and slowly row toward the shore, driving
the squid, which of course swim backward
in an opposite direction from the
light, upon the beach, where they may be
gathered by thousands after such an expedition.
Another method of capture is
by jigging; the jig is made of a piece of
lead some two inches in length which is
armed with a circle of sharp, unbarbed
wires pointing upward and curving outward.
The process of jigging is accomplished
as follows: the jig is attached to
twelve or fifteen feet of stout line and is
lowered into the water, which is generally
chosen of a depth of ten feet from the side
of a small boat. When near the bottom it
is kept moving slowly up and down until
a squid is felt upon it, when it is suddenly
drawn to the surface with the squid attached.
These squid, when caught, are
used for bait, a single fishing smack being
known to use as many as eighty thousand
squids in a single season.</p>
<p>A familiar object to most canary-bird
fanciers is the cuttle-bone placed in the
cages of these birds for them to sharpen
their beaks upon. This &ldquo;cuttle-bone&rdquo; is
the internal support of the Cuttle-fish
(Sepia officinalis) and is homologous with
the pen of the squid, mentioned above.
The animal of Sepia is short and rounded,
with a large head surrounded by a row of
eight short arms and two very long tentacular
arms, ending in expanded clubs
armed with powerful suckers. Like the
Octopus and Squid, the Cuttle-fish is capable
of many changes of colors by the
contraction and expansion of its pigment
cells. They are found throughout
the world, living near the shore, but the
species found about European shores are
the best known.</p>

<h2 id="c18">THE TRAILING ARBUTUS.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Epigaea repens.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Many years ago, before the Mayflower
had cast anchor in Plymouth
Bay or Columbus had landed at San
Salvador, an aged indian sat shivering
in his wigwam. Vainly had he sought
for fuel and in his extremity he called
upon the Great Spirit, that he might
not perish with the cold. Crouching
over the dying embers of his fire
he stoically awaited the end, when
suddenly there appeared before him a
beautiful maiden wreathed with wild
flowers and carrying in her hands,
buds of the willow. Ferns and grasses
draped her form and her moccasins
were fashioned from pure white lilies.
When she breathed the landscape suddenly
blossomed with the thousand
hues of nature and the warm rains fell
in obedience to her will.</p>
<p>Under the influence of this spirit of
the springtime the aged red man
slumbered and, as his head sank upon
his breast, the sunshine came out in all
its splendor and a blue bird alighted
upon the top of the wigwam. Slowly
the maiden passed her hand above the
old indian and gradually he shrank
away until nothing remained but a
cluster of green leaves. Then taking
from her bosom a cluster of rosy blossoms,
she concealed them among the
leaves, bestowing upon them her own
sweetness and fragrance and telling
them that as the harbingers of spring,
all who would inhale their fragrance,
must bow the knee in honor of the
vernal goddess. The maiden then
passed away through the woods and
over the prairies and wherever her footsteps
lingered, there grows today the
sweet-breathed mayflower.</p>
<p>Whether or not this fanciful story
relates the real origin of the Trailing
Arbutus, Ground Laurel or Mayflower,
as it is variously called in different sections
of the country, the fact remains
that it follows closely in the footsteps
of spring, often pushing up its dainty
blossoms through the leaves and snow.
It is always known as the Mayflower
throughout New England and the old
story of its being Flora&rsquo;s first offering
to the ocean-tossed pilgrims as they
landed at Plymouth, in appreciation of
which they named it the Mayflower in
memory of their vessel, has endeared
the beautiful plant to every New England
heart and has caused it to be
placed in Cupid&rsquo;s keeping, along with
the Scotch blue bell, the German corn
flower and the Swiss edelweiss.</p>
<p>The Trailing Arbutus (Epigaea
repens) belongs to the Heath family or
Ericace&aelig; and constitutes the only species
of the genus. Like the partridge
berry which is often associated with it
in pine woods and sandy soils, it is still
in a state of transition, although it has
been developing for centuries. As a
rule, plants have the stamens and
pistils in the same blossom or part in
one and part in another. The Mayflower,
however, does not carry out this
arrangement. Either the anthers or
the stigmas are abortive or partially
so, or in other words, the perfect stigmas
are usually associated with abortive
anthers and vice versa. In this
manner, nature has wisely provided for
cross fertilization which is accomplished
largely by insects, as the structure of
the plant is not adapted to wind fertilization.
The chosen agents for this
process are honey bees, and a few early
moths and butterflies, to which the
nectar is served by this beautiful Hebe
of the spring and who carry the pollen
from one flower to another.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>A wise provision of nature has been
pointed out whereby ants are kept away
from the nectar which they would devour
without accomplishing the purposes
for which it was created. Every
rocky hillside on which the Trailing
Arbutus is frequently found, swarms
with ants which are debarred from the
blossoms by hairs which project upward
from the inner surfaces of the corolla
and the outer surfaces of the ovary and
style and effectually prevent the ants
from entering but are not sufficiently
rigid to keep out the larger insects.</p>
<p>As a rule, the pollen bearing flowers
are larger and whiter than the others.
The stigma bearing blossoms, while
small, more than offset their defect by
a rosy color which makes the flowers
far more attractive than their larger but
paler rivals.</p>
<p>Very little success has been achieved
in domesticating the Trailing Arbutus.
It is essentially a wild creature and
prefers to waste its fragrance on the
desert air. Success may be had, however,
if the conditions under which the
plants are found growing are preserved
as nearly as possible. Yearling plants
should be selected and plenty of roots
taken or results can be obtained from
planting seeds, but as these are difficult
to obtain, the other method is the
more satisfactory.</p>

<h2 id="c20">THE MOUNTAIN LAUREL.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Kalmia latifolia.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>About the middle of the eighteenth
century an enthusiastic botanist and collector,
Peter Kalm, gathered specimens in
America of a beautiful plant which he
carried back to the gardens of Europe
and also to his preceptor, the naturalist
Linnaeus. In the year 1753 Linnaeus
named the plant, honoring his pupil by
giving to the plant the generic name Kalmia.
He also gave it the specific name
latifolia, referring to its broad leaves.</p>
<p>The genus Kalmia includes six known
species, five of which are natives of eastern
North America and one a native of
Cuba. They are all beautiful shrubs,
varying in height from a few inches to
several feet.</p>
<p>The plant of our illustration is a native
of the eastern portion of the United
States, where it grows in sandy or rocky
woods and is more abundant in mountainous
regions. This shrub, which
grows to a maximum height of twenty
feet, is a superb object early in June,
when it is covered with corymbs of rather
large pink or pinkish-white flowers and
numerous evergreen leaves.</p>
<p>Easily cultivated and highly ornamental,
it has been introduced into the
greenhouses and gardens of this and
European countries.</p>
<p>In spite of the beauty of this plant, it
has a bad reputation, for its leaves are
narcotic and poisonous to some animals.
&ldquo;Even the intelligent grouse, hard
pressed with hunger when deep snow covers
much of their chosen food, are sometimes
found dead and their crops distended
by these leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We cannot show the characteristics of
this plant in any better way than to quote
from &ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s Garden,&rdquo; where we find
the following passage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the Kalmias resort to a most ingenious
device for compelling insect visitors
to carry their pollen from blossom
to blossom. A newly opened flower
has its stigma erected where the incoming
bee must leave on its sticky surface
the four minute orange-like grains carried
from the anther of another flower
on the hairy underside of her body.
Now, each anther is tucked away in one
of the ten little pockets of the saucer-shaped
blossom and the elastic filaments
are strained upward like a bow. After
hovering above the nectary, the bee has
only to descend towards it, when her leg,
touching against one of the hair-triggers
of the spring trap, pop! goes the little
anther-gun, discharging pollen from
its bores as it flies upward. So delicately
is the mechanism adjusted, the
slightest jar or rough handling releases
the anthers; but, on the other hand,
should insects be excluded by a net
stretched over the plant, the flowers will
fall off and wither without firing off their
pollen-charged guns. At least this is
true in the great majority of tests. As
in the case of hot-house flowers, no fertile
seed is set when nets keep away the
laurel&rsquo;s benefactors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of our readers reside near the
home of the Mountain Laurel and can
examine the interesting features of this
beautiful plant in Nature&rsquo;s own garden.
Those that do this will be well repaid.</p>

<p class="bq">&ldquo;A land of hops and poppy-mingled fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="bq"><span class="lr">&mdash;Tennyson: Aylmer&rsquo;s Field.</span></p>
<p>The hop plant is a creeping perennial
with several stems or branches attaining
a length of fifteen to twenty-five feet. It
has numerous opposite three to five
lobed, palmately veined, coarsely toothed
leaves with long leaf stalks (petioles).
Flowers unisexual, that is staminate and
pistillate flowers separate, either on separate
plants (dioecious) or upon different
branches of the same plant (monoecious).
Flowers insignificant in loose, drooping
axillary panicles. Fruit a cone-like catkin
usually designated a strobile.</p>
<p>The hop has been called the northern
vine. It is found in a wild state throughout
Europe, excepting the extreme north,
and extends east to the Caucasus and
through central Asia. It is a handsome
plant and not infrequently used as an arbor
plant. The lower or basal leaves are
very large, gradually decreasing in size
toward the apex. H. lupulus is the only
representative of the genus.</p>
<p>It is rather remarkable that a plant so
widely distributed and familiar should
not have been known to the Greeks and
Romans. Its cultivation in Europe dates
back to the eighth and ninth centuries.
It was, however, not extensively cultivated
until about the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.</p>
<p>The word hop (German, Hopfen) is of
very uncertain origin. According to
some authorities it is traceable to the old
English, hoppan, in reference to the habit
of the plant in climbing over hedges and
fences. Humulus is said to refer to its
habit of creeping over the soil. Lupulus
(diminutive of lupus, wolf) is said to refer
to the pernicious and destructive influence
the hop plant has upon plants
which it uses as a support, especially the
willows. Plinius named it Lupus salictarius,
that is, the willow wolf or willow
destroyer.</p>
<p>Beside the countries above named hops
is also cultivated in Brazil and other
South American countries, Australia and
India. There are several cultivated varieties.
According to most authorities it
is not supposed to be indigenous to North
America, but Millspaugh expresses it as
his opinion that it is indigenous northward
and westward, growing in alluvial
soil, blossoming in July and fruiting in
September.</p>
<p>The plants are planted in rows and the
rapidly growing branches trained upon
poles stuck into the soil. Three or four
male plants (with staminate flowers) are
grown in an acre patch to supply the necessary
pollen. Some authorities state,
however, that the female plants develop
enough staminate flowers to effect pollination.
It is extensively cultivated in
England, Germany and France. Also in
New England, New York, Michigan, and
in fact nearly every State in the Union.</p>
<p>In Belgium the young, tender tops of
the plants are cut off in the spring and
eaten like asparagus, especially recommended
to the pale and anaemic and those
with scrofulous taints.</p>
<p>The peculiar hop-like fruiting known
as strobiles are collected in the fall of the
year (September to October), dried and
tightly packed into bales. The base of
the scales of the strobile are covered with
a yellowish powder, consisting of resin-bearing
glands, known as lupulin. One
pound of hops yields about one ounce of
lupulin. Since the medicinal virtues of
hops reside in the lupulin it will be readily
understood that the hops from which the
glands have been removed is of little or
no medicinal value. Lupulin as well as
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
the hops have a faint, peculiar, somewhat
yeasty odor, which increases with age due
to the development of valerianic acid.
For medicinal purposes only fresh hops
should be used.</p>
<p>The principal use of hops is in the
manufacture of beer, to which it imparts
the peculiarly bitter taste, and its repute
as a tonic. For this purpose enormous
quantities are consumed in Germany and
England. The exhausted hops from the
breweries form an excellent fertilizer for
light soils. The leaves have been used
as fodder for cows. Leaves, stems and
roots possess astringent properties and
have been used in tanning. In Sweden
the fibre of the stems is used in manufacturing
a very durable white cloth, not
unlike the cloth made from hemp and
flax.</p>
<p>Hops is used medicinally. It at first
causes a very slight excitation of brain
and heart, followed by a rather pronounced
disposition to sleep. Pillows
stuffed with hops form a very popular
domestic remedy for wakefulness. Hop
bags dipped in hot water form a very
soothing external application in painful
inflammatory conditions, especially of the
abdominal organs. It has undoubted
value as a bitter tonic in dyspepsia and in
undue cerebral excitation. Tincture of
lupulin and red pepper (capsicum) enjoys
the reputation of being a very efficient
substitute for alcoholic stimulants when
their use is to be discontinued. Earlier
physicians recommended hops very highly
in kidney and liver complaints, as a
&ldquo;blood purifier&rdquo; and to cure eruptive skin
troubles. It is recommended in nervous
troubles and in delirium tremens. The
roots were formerly employed as a substitute
for sarsaparilla.</p>
<p>Hops contains an etherial oil, resin and
tannic acid. The oil and the resin are
important constituents in the manufacture
of beer. The young shoots contain
asparagin, etherial oil, resin and sugar.</p>

<h2>Transcriber&rsquo;s Note on Linking between eBooks</h2>
<p>This eBook contains &ldquo;relative&rdquo; links to other Project Gutenberg eBooks. These
links function correctly whether the books are read online, or copied to a directory on a local drive or a web.</p>

<p>To install these books in another file system, create a subdirectory for each eBook, as in this
outline:</p>

<dl class="undent">
<dt>mybooks/</dt>
<dd>40000/</dd>
<dd class="t">40000-h/</dd>
<dd class="t2">40000-h.htm</dd>
<dd class="t2">images/</dd>
<dd class="t3">...</dd>
<dd>40001/</dd>
<dd class="t">40001-h/</dd>
<dd class="t2">40001-h.htm</dd>
<dd class="t2">images/</dd>
<dd class="t3">...</dd>
<dd>...</dd>
</dl>

<p>Each eBook is in a separate directory; its directory name is the Project Gutenberg number for the eBook.</p>

<p>Each eBook directory may contain files in various formats; only the HTML files are relevant here; other files
are optional.</p>

<p>HTML files are in a subdirectory consisting of the Gutenberg number followed by &ldquo;-h&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The HTML file itself has a name consisting of the Gutenberg number followed by &ldquo;-h&rdquo;,
with a file extension of &ldquo;.htm&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Associated media files (such as images, MIDI files, etc.) are contained in a further
subdirectory &ldquo;images&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">To view these files, open any of the &ldquo;*-h.htm&rdquo; files in a web browser.</p>
